# Create the guess-a-number game using query parameters. (Reminder: This is the game where the app chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what it is. It also tells the user after each guess whether to guess higher or lower.) One caveat: Instead of having the program choosing a random number in advance, just choose a specific number, such as 36. One other gotcha: All params are initially treated as strings, so youâ€™ll have to do some conversion to integer to work around that.
